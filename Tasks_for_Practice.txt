01. Two D8s: Create a simulation showing what happens when you roll two
eight-sided dice 1000 times. Try to picture what you think the visualization will
look like before you run the simulation; then see if your intuition was correct.
Gradually increase the number of rolls until you start to see the limits of your
system’s capabilities.
02. Three Dice: When you roll three D6 dice, the smallest number you can roll
is 3 and the largest number is 18. Create a visualization that shows what happens
when you roll three D6 dice.
03. Multiplication: When you roll two dice, you usually add the two numbers
together to get the result. Create a visualization that shows what happens if
you multiply these numbers instead.
04 Die Comprehensions: For clarity, the listings in this section use the long
form of for loops. If you’re comfortable using list comprehensions, try writing a
comprehension for one or both of the loops in each of these programs.
05. Practicing with Both Libraries: Try using Matplotlib to make a die-rolling
visualization, and use Plotly to make the visualization for a random walk. (You’ll
need to consult the documentation for each library to complete this exercise.)
